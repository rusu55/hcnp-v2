They provide services for those struggling to care for a loved one who did not "fit" into traditional health systems: stroke, Parkinson, Alzheimer disease, traumatic brain injury, debilitating disorders, etc. The diagnoses were different, but the families shared common challenges: few community resources, isolation, lack of information, and drastic changes in family roles.'
